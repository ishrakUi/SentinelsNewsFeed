We are team sentinel. Let us introduce our news presenting solution "iFeed".

Future Plan:
We have a plan to deploy the share post. User can share any post of other people, either directly or adding some of their own captions Also, we want to deploy the save option, by which user can save any post in their timeline which they can also delete in future. Moreover, user can request for follow each other and they can also follow any groups.
